# Alcohol Drug Diagnostic Instrument (ADDIS)

## Description
The Alcohol Drug Diagnostic Instrument (ADDIS) is a structured interview form comprising 75 fundamental questions posed to the patient or client. Most questions focus on the individual's use, experiences, and perceived consequences of alcohol, medications, and drugs. The response options are "yes" or "no." If a question is answered with "yes," follow-up questions regarding the past year, past month, and age of onset are asked when relevant. The instrument includes two diagnostic checklists for assessing addiction and harmful use according to ICD-10, and addiction and abuse according to DSM-IV.
